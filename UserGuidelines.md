The GUI of our application is pretty simple and (hopefully) self-explanatory. Nevertheless you are here, so you can find the basic functionalities explained below.

After choosing a Hashtag you want to explore, you can select a date. In each [cluster](ClusterElements.md) [visualization](Visualization.md) you can find Tweets of one whole week, with the displayed date as starting point.

Navigation is pretty easy, just left-click on a cluster to see the relative sub clusters. The size of each cluster gives you an indication of the amount of analyzed Tweets that went into that cluster (e.g. for calculating the [sentiment](SentimentTagging.md)), the color gives you an indication of the mean sentiment that cluster has.

Below the visualization you can find the Tweets that are contained in the selected cluster with their relative sentiment.

In the Options Tab of our application you can adjust the [crawler](Crawler.md) interval and (de-)select hashtags that are to be crawled.
